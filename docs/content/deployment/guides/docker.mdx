# Deploying Dagster to Docker

If you are running on AWS ECS or another container-based orchestration system, you'll likely want to package Dagit using a Docker image.

A minimal skeleton `Dockerfile` that will run Dagit is shown below:

```dockerfile file=/deploying/docker/Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7-slim

RUN mkdir -p /opt/dagster/dagster_home /opt/dagster/app

RUN pip install dagit dagster-postgres

# Copy your code and workspace to /opt/dagster/app
COPY repo.py workspace.yaml /opt/dagster/app/

ENV DAGSTER_HOME=/opt/dagster/dagster_home/

# Copy dagster instance YAML to $DAGSTER_HOME
COPY dagster.yaml /opt/dagster/dagster_home/

WORKDIR /opt/dagster/app

EXPOSE 3000

ENTRYPOINT ["dagit", "-h", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "3000"]
```

You'll also need to include a `workspace.yaml` file in the same directory as the Dockerfile to configure your [workspace](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/workspaces):

```yaml file=/deploying/docker/workspace.yaml
load_from:
  # References the file copied into your Dockerfile
  - python_file: repo.py
```

as well as a `dagster.yaml` file to configure your [Dagster instance](/deployment/dagster-instance):

```yaml file=/deploying/docker/dagster.yaml
storage:
  postgres:
    postgres_db:
      username:
        env: DAGSTER_PG_USERNAME
      password:
        env: DAGSTER_PG_PASSWORD
      hostname:
        env: DAGSTER_PG_HOST
      db_name:
        env: DAGSTER_PG_DB
      port: 5432

compute_logs:
  module: dagster_aws.s3.compute_log_manager
  class: S3ComputeLogManager
  config:
    bucket: "mycorp-dagster-compute-logs"
    prefix: "dagster-test-"

local_artifact_storage:
  module: dagster.core.storage.root
  class: LocalArtifactStorage
  config:
    base_dir: "/opt/dagster/local/"
```

In cases where you're using environment variables to configure the instance, you should ensure these environment variables are exposed in the running Dagit container.

Dagit servers expose a health check endpoint at `/dagit_info`, which returns a JSON response like:

```JSON
{
  "dagit_version": "0.12.0",
  "dagster_graphql_version": "0.12.0",
  "dagster_version": "0.12.0"
}
```

## Multi-container Docker deployment

More advanced dagster deployments will require deploying more than one container. For example, if you are using [dagster-daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon) to run schedules and sensors or manage a queue of runs, you'll likely want a separate container running the `dagster-daemon` service. This service must have access to your `dagster.yaml` and `workspace.yaml` files, just like the Dagit container. You can also configure your [workspace](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/workspaces) so that your code can be updated and deployed separately in its own container running a gRPC server, without needing to redeploy the other dagster services. To enable this setup, include a container exposing a gRPC server at a port, and add that port in your `workspace.yaml` file.

For example, your user code container might have the following Dockerfile:

```dockerfile file=/deploying/docker/Dockerfile_user_code
FROM python:3.7-slim

# Checkout and install dagster libraries needed to run the gRPC server
# exposing your repository to dagit and dagster-daemon, and to load
# the DagsterInstance

RUN pip install \
    dagster \
    dagster-postgres \
    dagster-docker

# Set $DAGSTER_HOME and copy dagster instance there

ENV DAGSTER_HOME=/opt/dagster/dagster_home

RUN mkdir -p $DAGSTER_HOME

COPY dagster.yaml $DAGSTER_HOME

# Add repository code

WORKDIR /opt/dagster/app

COPY repo.py /opt/dagster/app

# Run dagster gRPC server on port 4000

EXPOSE 4000

# Using CMD rather than ENTRYPOINT allows the command to be overridden in
# run launchers or executors to run other commands using this image
CMD ["dagster", "api", "grpc", "-h", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "4000", "-f", "repo.py"]
```

and your workspace might look like:

```yaml file=/deploying/docker/workspace_grpc.yaml
load_from:
  # Each entry here corresponds to a container that exposes a gRPC server.
  - grpc_server:
      host: docker_example_user_code
      port: 4000
      location_name: "example_user_code"
```

When you update your code, you can rebuild and restart your user code container without needing to redeploy other parts of the system. Dagit will automatically notice that a new server has been redeployed and prompt you to refresh your workspace.

When you add or remove a user code container, you can also remove the corresponding entry from your `workspace.yaml` file. If this file is mounted on the dagit and dagster-daemon containers as a volume, you can pick up the changes in Dagit by reloading the workspace from the Workspace tab. The dagster-daemon container will automatically pick up the changes by periodically reloading the workspace from the `workspace.yaml` file.

## Launching runs in containers

To launch each run its own container, you can add the <PyObject module="dagster_docker" object="DockerRunLauncher" /> to your `dagster.yaml` file:

```yaml file=/deploying/docker/run_launcher.yaml
run_launcher:
  module: dagster_docker
  class: DockerRunLauncher
  config:
    env_vars:
      - DAGSTER_POSTGRES_USER
      - DAGSTER_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      - DAGSTER_POSTGRES_DB
```

This launcher will start each run in a new container, using whatever image that you set in the `DAGSTER_CURRENT_IMAGE` environment variable in your user code container (which will usually be the same image as the user code container itself)

Any container that launches runs (usually the `dagster-daemon` container if you are maintaining a [run queue](/deployment/run-coordinator#queuedruncoordinator) or launching runs from schedules or sensors) must have permissions to create Docker containers in order to use this run launcher (mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` as a volume is one way to give it these permissions).

## Mounting volumes

You can mount your code in your user code container so that you don't have to rebuild your container whenever your code changes. Even if you're using volume mounts, you still need to restart the container whenever your code changes.

If you are mounting your code as a volume in your user code container and using `DockerRunLauncher` to launch each run in a new container, you must specify your volume mounts in the `DockerRunLauncher` config as well. For example:

```yaml file=/deploying/docker/run_launcher_volumes.yaml
run_launcher:
  module: dagster_docker
  class: DockerRunLauncher
  config:
    env_vars:
      - DAGSTER_POSTGRES_USER
      - DAGSTER_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      - DAGSTER_POSTGRES_DB
    container_kwargs:
      volumes:
        - /absolute/path/to/local/repo.py:/opt/dagster/app/
```

## Example

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/deploy_docker" />

This example demonstrates a Dagster deployment using `docker-compose` that includes a Dagit container for loading and launching jobs, a `dagster-daemon` container for managing a run queue and submitting runs from schedules and sensors, a Postgres container for persistent storage, and a container with user code. The Dagster instance uses <PyObject module="dagster_docker" object="DockerRunLauncher" /> to launch each run in its own container.

To start the deployment, run `docker-compose up`.
